## Project Introduction
This project is about a collaborative shopping platform. This project has based on woth RMI server, RMI desktop client application, REST API, and Web client. RMI server and RMI desktop client application have developed by using the JAVA programming language. The IDE we have used here is WebStorm.  We have developed REST API by using Node js programming language and WebStorm as the IDE. The Web Client has developed by using HTML and CSS programming language and the IDE we used to develop this in WebStorm. MongoDB is the database we have used here. 
We use a name as “Native-E-Mart” for collaborative shopping platforms. Here we have provided data for electronic goods. We have categorized the items into the main categories and applied them accordingly. The purchaser can look at the items they want and select the items first. The selected item is first included in the card. Later, if he buys the items on the cart, he can order them. The price will then be calculated according to the items ordered to be purchased. Once the payment is made the user get a confirmation of the appointment via SMS and email. 
There the customer can make payments through online. The payment for the items bought can be made using credit cards or using the mobile phone number (which would be added to the user’s mobile bill). Ordered items can be delivered home by delivery services. There the customer will be charged a fee for the delivery service. 
Hear the sellers first has to put their goods in the service before the customer can buy the goods, they want. Sellers can add/update/delete items. Here we have used a separate admin panel for the project because the functions are different for different user types.
