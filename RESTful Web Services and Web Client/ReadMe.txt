* Note

We are implemented Rest-API using node js and Web-client implemented using HTML, JavaScript, Jquery and AJAX.

So we added the web-client inside the server -> client folder and setup it runs with the server startup (this configured in package.json file).

If you want to run web-client seperately, 
Goto -> RestApi and WebClient -> server -> client -> index.html
